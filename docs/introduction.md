# TARS: Intelligent Companion

## Overview

We are a physical AI startup developing smart devices that serve as intelligent companions. Our mission is to create AI-powered wearables that go beyond traditional functionalities by deeply integrating into users' daily lives. Our devices are designed to be aware of users' physiological states and environments, offering proactive support to enhance well-being, focus, productivity, social interaction, and daily intellectual needs, all powered by our robust development platform.

Our current hardware platform is smart glasses equipped with a minimal set of sensors, cutting-edge AI, and an intuitive design to assist users in focusing, listening, seeing, and understanding their surroundings and social contexts in a more meaningful way.

## Features

- **Intelligent Environment Awareness**: Our sensors and AI algorithms provide real-time insights into the user's surroundings, making the system context-aware and responsive to changes in the environment.
- **Contextual Understanding**: The AI system interprets visual, auditory, and physiological signals, offering personalized feedback to help users better engage with their environment and people around them.
- **Stress Monitoring and Well-being Support**: Stress monitoring is our first application, aimed at providing real-time suggestions to help users manage stress, avoid stressful situations, and enhance overall well-being by tracking metrics like heart rate variability (HRV).

## System Architecture

Our platform is built on a **Vertical Agent Structure**, enabling modularity and scalability:

- **Vertical Agent Structure**: The architecture is designed with specialized agents, each responsible for processing specific types of inputâ€”such as visual, audio, or physiological data. This approach allows each agent to operate independently, making it easier to integrate new functionalities and scale the system across different domains. The agents work together to generate holistic insights, which are presented to the user in an intuitive and actionable manner.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Our architecture is designed for easy integration of new capabilities, sensors, and AI models, ensuring that the system remains adaptable to emerging use cases beyond well-being, including productivity enhancement, environmental analysis, and social interaction support.

## Key Application Areas

Current system is designed as a versatile intelligent companion capable of assisting users across multiple domains, including:

- **Intelligent Personal Companion**: Assisting users in managing daily activities, maintaining focus, and improving cognitive performance.
- **Social Interaction Support**: Assisting users in better understanding social cues and their surroundings, leading to more meaningful and confident interactions.
- **Personal Well-being**: Monitoring physiological signals in real time and providing actionable feedback to maintain mental and physical health as part of an integrated companion experience.

## Technical Capabilities

### AI and Machine Learning

- **Visual Context Analysis**: Leveraging deep learning models to analyze visual input from the glasses' camera, allowing the system to understand and respond to environmental cues.
- **Speech Recognition**: Utilizing advanced models for real-time speech recognition, enabling seamless interaction with the user.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Aggregating sensor data from multiple inputs to generate comprehensive insights into the user's state and surroundings.
- **Language Model Integration**: Using language models to provide context-aware feedback and suggestions that help users engage effectively with their environment.

### Hardware Integration

Our current hardware is equipped with state-of-the-art hardware to provide an optimal user experience:

- **Physiological Sensors**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors capture critical HRV signals providing insights into the user's health and well-being.
- **Camera and Microphone**: The integrated camera and microphone offer visual and auditory context awareness, enabling the AI to better understand and assist the user.
- **Edge Computing**: With on-device AI processing, the glasses offer low-latency responses and maintain data privacy by processing information locally without relying heavily on cloud services.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The smart glasses collect real-time data from visual, auditory, and physiological sensors.
2. **AI Processing**: Data is processed using advanced AI models to generate personalized and meaningful insights.
3. **Intelligent Assistance**: The system detects stress levels and environmental cues to deliver personalized guidance aimed at improving overall quality of life.
